# Mapfo

A mobile app providing offline access to essential resources such as directions to local food banks and homeless shelters by using SMS technology. Built for the Google Developer Student Club Solutions Challenge 2020.

## Tech

`Flutter`, `Twilio`

## Motives
In today's world, 10% of our population have access to SMS in the form of mobile phones, without any access to WiFi or mobile data. Even people who do have internet access often may have to rely on public WiFi available at select locations. Our app aims to bridge this accessibility gap and empower people with the ability to access basic essential resources like directions to nearby food banks without requiring the luxury of the internet.

## Development

Developed in a cross-functional team of 4. We utilized the Flutter framework to build our front-end and the Twilio SMS API to network between clients and our server.
