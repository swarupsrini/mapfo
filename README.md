## Motives
In today's world, 10% of our population have access to SMS in the form of mobile phones, without any access to WiFi or mobile data. Even people who do have internet access often may have to rely on public WiFi available at select locations. Our app aims to bridge this accessibility gap and empower people with the ability to access basic essential resources like directions to nearby food banks without requiring the luxury of the internet.
